      <title>Introducing CTransifex</title>

      <note>
        <para>CTransifex is a Joomla extension made for Joomla
        developers.</para>
      </note>

      <para>As a Joomla developer you should be no stranger to the problems
      associated with the distribution of multilingual extensions. In the past
      our users were sending translations for our extensions through mail or
      they were uploading them to our forum. It was really a tedious task to
      keep a track of the latest translations. What do you do when a language
      file needs to be updated? How do you contact the user who has given you
      the original translation? </para>

      <para>Thanks to transifex.com this is a problem of the past. If you
      haven't heard about transifex yet, you should go and check them out!
      Thanks to their online platform users are able to translate the source
      language files of your extensions into any language they speak.
      Everything is done online, you don't have to download zip files to see
      how much of a file is translated. If you update a source file, then it
      is immediately visible to your translators that there are strings that
      need to be updated. </para>

      <para>This tremendously improves the translation process - you don't
      need to exchange files with your users since everything is done from a
      central location. </para>

      <para>Last but not least - if you join a translation pool such as
      opentranslators.org - you'll have a reach to 1000s of translators
      willing to translate your extensions. </para>

      <para>Opentranslators &amp; transifex greatly improved the quality of
      the translations of our extension, but suddenly we had a new problem.
      How to distribute those translations in the most effective way? In the
      past we were creating a single installation package of our extensions
      that contained all of the available translations. Now this was fine, but
      translators are always few days behind... that meant that we had to
      distribute our extensions with non-complete language files and when a
      translation is available we had to update the whole package to add it.
      As you can imagine this is not a very effective process. Since transifex
      offers a powerful API, we decided that it was time to automate the
      process. </para>

      <para>Now instead of distributing the extensions with the currently
      available language translations we distribute them with only the source
      language (English in our case). If the user needs a French, German or
      whatever translation - he can come to our website and download a
      language pack that would contain that translation. The best part of
      those language packs is that they are automatically generated. Whenever
      a translator updates a language file on the transifex server, the
      language pack on our server will be updated as well. Once setup we don't
      have to do anything to serve those language packs to our users. The
      added benefit for our users is that they can always see how complete
      each language pack is, what was the latest update date &amp; if they
      want they can head up to transifex and translate the remaining strings.

  <chapter>
    <title>Installation and updates</title>

    <para>Installing CTransifex is no different than installing any other
    Joomla!™ extension on your site. You can read the complete instructions
    for installing Joomla!™ extensions on the <ulink
    url="http://help.joomla.org/content/view/1476/235/">official help
    page</ulink> .Throughout this chapter we assume that you are familiar with
    these instructions and we will not duplicate them.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Getting the installation packages</title>

      <para>You can download the latest installation packages by visiting our
      site at <ulink
      url="https://compojoom.com">https://compojoom.com</ulink>. Go to
      Download -&gt; CTransifex menu item. The releases are listed in
      descending order with the newest release always on top. Click on the
      release number and then download the ZIP package.</para>

      <para>You can use the installation package to update from previous
      version as well; just install it, without uninstalling the old
      package.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Updating to the latest version</title>

      <section>
        <title>Checking for the latest version and upgrading</title>

        <para>You can easily check for the latest published version of
        CTransifex by visiting https://compojoom.com and going to
        Downloads-&gt;CTransifex.</para>

        <para>Updating CTransifex to the latest version is by no means
        different than installing the component! You do not have to uninstall
        the previous version; in fact, you are discouraged from doing so.
        Simply follow the installation instructions so as to install the
        latest CTransifex version over the existing installation. That's all!
        All your settings are preserved.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Live update</title>

        <para>There is also an alternate update path, if your server supports
        it. It is called the "Live Update" feature (thanks to Nicholas K.
        Dionysopoulos from http://akeebabackup.com) . Whenever you click on
        the Live update button in the Navigation toolbar, it will
        automatically check for the existence of an updated version and it
        will notify you. Clicking on the update button allows you to perform a
        live update without further interaction. Do note that if your server
        is protected by a firewall you'll have to enable port 80 and 443 TCP
        traffic to https://compojoom.com for this feature to work
        properly.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Setting up your transifex project</title>

      <para>Currenly the only way to achieve automation is to have conventions
      that you always keep. In this section of the User guide we will present
      you with our workflow and will give you an example how to setup your
      development environment. You can of course setup your dev. environment
      however you see fit, but we cannot garantee that the ctransifex
      extension will work for you in that case.</para>

      <para>First let us look at our folder structure.</para>

      <graphic fileref="images/structure.PNG"/>

      <para>As you can see from the screenshot above our project structure has
      a very specific form. First of all - all the files that have anything to
      do with the extension that will develop will land in the com_ctransifex
      folder. Then inside that folder we store the transifex config (in the
      .tx folder). Inside the build folder we have our phing scripts that help
      us create the zip package of an extension. The docs folder is obviously
      for documentation and the source folder is actually where we have the
      extensions code. As you can see from the screenshot the content of the
      source folder resembles the joomla folder structure. </para>
